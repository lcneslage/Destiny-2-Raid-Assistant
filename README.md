This program is a Raid encounter guide for players of the Destiny 2 video game.
Start by choosing which raid you want help with, followed by which encounter. You can choose whether you want a loadout recommendation or a guide to the encounter's mechanics.
After your guide has been generated, you can choose whether you want to save the guide on your computer or not, the saved guides are contained in a .txt file called "your_saved_guides.txt".
You can view your saved guides, delete your saved guides, and update any saved guides with notes you want to add.
All guides are generated using GPT4.
